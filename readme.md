# WC Category Discounts

WC Category Discounts is a WordPress plugin that allows users to apply a discount to all products within a selected category in WooCommerce. The discount can be set as a fixed amount or a percentage, and the plugin provides an option to apply the discount only to products that are not on sale or only if the discount provides more savings than the current sale price.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files from the GitHub repository.
2. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Alternately download the zip and install with: Plugins > Add new > Upload plugin

## Usage

1. Go to the Category Discounts settings page (WooCommerce > Category Discounts).
2. Select a category from the dropdown list.
3. Set the discount type (fixed or percentage) and the discount amount.
4. Click 'Add discount'

Discounts can be edited from the table. They can also toggled to apply to sale items or not.

## Features

1. Percentage or fixed discounts
2. When applied to sale items, largest discount will be applied to a product. e.g. Product has predefined price of $100, a sale price of $180. Category discount is fixed discount of $50. The category discount will be applied because it is the larger saving.
